# Java_Lab_Classwork
Contains the worksheets and code for the programs performed as classwork in JAVA Lab
- Each pair of Worksheet and Code is placed in its own file named as WS1, WS2 etc.
- Worksheets as pdfs named in with acronyms WS1An WS2An...
- Codes as CodeWS1, CodeWS2... (each having extention as a.java files)


## Debugging Tips
- Make sure to comment out or remove the package named `package practiceWorks;` : It suggests that the code was initially a part of that package implemented on the local machine server.
- Ensure to save the file with the same name as the name of the Super Class which contains the `main()` method in the given code.  
  For example if the code is like this:
  ```
  public class Super{
    /*
    ...some code
    ... may contain other classes methods, variables etc.
  */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    //some code
    }
  }

  ```
  Then the name of the file should be `Super.java`.
- Save the file with `.java` extention.  


## Additional Tools
